# Playing

Install Stella from here: https://stella-emu.github.io/

The .asm and .h files aren't necessary to run. Open Stella, navigate to your folder with cart.bin (this is the binary file acting like a game cartridge), and open it.

The game is designed to run on NTSC format. To ensure, open Stella, under Options->Game Properties, under TV Format, select NTSC.

Run and enjoy!
